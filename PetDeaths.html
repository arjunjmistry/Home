        <h2>I first met frontmen Liam and Graeme in a pub in Islington. Behind the awkwardly polite small-talk that comes with meeting new people, in the background, a friend had just received news of the passing of someone close. on TV, a virus had caused havoc on an unknown population in an unconfirmed location. Drawing the outlines of the venue stage in my notebook, I started taking notes on where they drew their inspiration from.</h2>
        <h2>Their topics of death, life and love, formed the backdrop for the next few months whilst developing a stage lighting strategy which reflected the storylines from their new album. With street lights invading my brand new curtainless flat, I considered knife-edge beams of light to capture the starkness of ‘Bats In Your Hair’. Watching traffic lights go red, smeared by the dew on the bus window a colour story was developed which reflected the setlist’s tidally shifting moods. Finally, in the laundrette when my machine broke down, a storyboard was assembled using the colour, texture and intensity of light as the medium.</h2>
