        <h3>Arjun Mistry designs art installations which explore interactions between light and material, through an understanding of visual perception and all its anomalies.</h3>
    
        <h3>His ideas and methodology draw from a thorough scientific knowledge of light and perception, after studying at UCL on the Msc for Light and Lighting, which he was fortunate to gain on two scholarships (Llewelyn-Davies & Bartlett scholarship).</h3>
            
        <h3>His thesis on cycle safety was conducted under the supervision of Peter Boyce, author and researcher of Human Factors in Lighting. He sought to close an ambiguity in road vehicle lighting regulations which permits the use of flashing and static bicycle lights, despite scientific research proving that both induce different physiological responses in the body. </h3>

        <h3>During this time he worked part-time as an architectural lighting designer, applying knowledge of how people perceive luminous environments to numerous developments in London’s growing urbanism. Prior to working in London, Arjun studied his BA at Manchester School of Architecture where, outside of his studies, he managed the architectural decor team for Europe’s largest student-run festival.</h3>
